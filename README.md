## Description

This api was created for friends to share their thoughts and react to one anothers reactions.

It helps close friends stay in touch and not have to navigate through other social media apps.  This app was not deployed but code can be viewed here, GitHub: https://github.com/magiscoding2113/Social_Network_API_NoSQL
